Comment:
 The XSLT files are released under the terms of the GNU LGPL. You may build
 customizations from these stylesheets using their public documented interfaces,
 using either xsl:import or xsl:include, with no restrictions on your customized
 stylesheets. You may also invoke the stylesheets freely, either with a simple
 XSLT processor such as xsltproc, or using an XSLT processing library within
 your program. The use of these stylesheets has no bearing on the licensing
 terms of the XSLT processing program you use.
 .
 The files output by the stylesheets are not affected by the terms of the LGPL.
 In particular, some of the stylesheets output program files rather than simple
 data files. The generated program files are also not affected by the LGPL.
 You can redistribute all generated files as you see fit.
 .
 As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
 copies of your document formatted by the tools in this package, you may
 redistribute unmodified copies of any images used or referenced in that
 formatted copy without restriction.

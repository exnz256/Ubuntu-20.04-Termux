Comment: MDA plugins are originally by Paul Kellett and were released under
 the GPLv2 or later, or the MIT license.
 This port is based on revision 10 of the MDA SVN repository at:
 https://mda-vst.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mda-vst
 .
 These plugins make no claim of compatibility, or any other relation, to VST.
 This code does not require the VST SDK, or any other non-free software.
 This code has never come into contact with any part of the VST SDK.
